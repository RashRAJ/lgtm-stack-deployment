# LGTM Stack Learning Journal

This document serves as a learning journal to track insights, challenges, and knowledge gained throughout the LGTM stack deployment project.

## Project Overview
**Start Date:** 12-June-2025  
**Project Goal:** Deploy and configure a complete LGTM observability stack on GKE using GitOps practices

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the LGTM stack components and their interactions
- [ ] Master GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
- [ ] Learn GKE cluster management and security best practices
- [ ] Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- [ ] Configure production-grade monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Secure services with proper authentication and authorization
